Estimated Duration (20 minutes)
## Purpose

- Align on scope, priorities, and next steps.
    
- Ensure the product meets core requirements by the halfway milestone.
    

---

## Product Scope

- Core functionality must be completed first.
    
- The main user journey should work end-to-end before adding additional features.
    
- Extra or complex features should be deferred until the core flow is validated.
    
- The feature document defines the MVP and is treated as a commitment.

## Feature Decisions

### Event Creation

- An event upload system is required.
    
- Discussion focused on who should be allowed to create events (users vs admins/moderators).
    
- Minimum requirement: users can add events (e.g., an “Add Event” button).
    
- Admin pages are optional for MVP and may be reconsidered later.
    

### Admin Dashboard

- Early prototyping of an admin dashboard was discussed to avoid late-stage design decisions.
    
- Admin functionality (user management, moderation) is important but scope-dependent.
    

### Feature Enhancements

- Audience reactions to events were discussed as a possible extension beyond the website.
    
- Features without a clear requirement should be listed under “Future Work.”
    
- Avoid adding features without a clear use case.
    

### Authentication

- Two-factor authentication is not required for MVP.
    
- May be reconsidered if ticketing or higher security needs are introduced.
    

---

## Documentation

- Documentation should define minimum required functionality.
    
- Avoid overly specific descriptions to allow flexibility during development.
    
- Use a “Future Work” section for features not guaranteed in the MVP.
    

---

## Research

- User research was discussed as potentially helpful.
    
- Scope estimates should be realistic.
    

---

## Design & Prototyping

- Backlog cleanup should be completed before moving fully into design.
    
- Figma prototypes will be used as a reference for development.
    
- Prototypes must be ready for review in the next meeting.
    

---

## Work Distribution

- Work will be split to balance backlog tasks and Figma design.
    
- A divide-and-conquer approach was agreed upon.
    

---

## Next Steps

- Finalize backlog priorities.
    
- Prepare Figma prototypes for review.
    
- Confirm MVP feature list.
